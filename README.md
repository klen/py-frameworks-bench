Python frameworks' benchmarks
=============================

There are some benchmarks for popular python frameworks.

* [Aiohttp](https://github.com/KeepSafe/aiohttp)       -- Http client/server for asyncio
* [Bottle](https://github.com/bottlepy/bottle)         -- Fast, simple and lightweight WSGI micro web-framework
* [Django](https://github.com/django/django)           -- The Web framework for perfectionists with deadlines
* [Falcon](https://github.com/falconry/falcon)         -- A high-performance Python framework for building cloud APIs
* [Flask](https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask)          -- A microframework based on Werkzeug, Jinja2 and good intentions
* [Muffin](https://github.com/klen/muffin)             -- A web-framework based on Asyncio stack
* [Pyramid](https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid)         -- A small, fast, down-to-earth, open source Python web framework
* [Tornado](https://github.com/tornadoweb/tornado)     -- A Python web framework and asynchronous networking library
* [Sanic](https://github.com/channelcat/sanic)         -- Sanic is a Flask-like Python 3.5+ web server that's written to go fast
* [Wheezy Web](https://bitbucket.org/akorn/wheezy.web) -- A lightweight, high performance, high concurrency WSGI web framework.
* [weppy](https://github.com/gi0baro/weppy)            -- The Web framework for humans

The goal of the project is not tests for deployment (like uwsgi vs gunicorn and
etc) but instead tests the frameworks itself.
