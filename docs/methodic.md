## Hardware

The benchmark runs as a [Github Action](https://github.com/features/actions).
According to the [github
documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-github-hosted-runners/about-github-hosted-runners)
the hardware specification for the runs is:

* 2-core vCPU (Intel® Xeon® Platinum 8272CL (Cascade Lake), Intel® Xeon® 8171M 2.1GHz (Skylake))
* 7 GB of RAM memory
* 14 GB of SSD disk space
* OS Ubuntu 20.04

## Software

[ASGI](https://asgi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) apps are running from docker using the gunicorn/uvicorn command:

    gunicorn -k uvicorn.workers.UvicornWorker -b 0.0.0.0:8080 app:app

Results received with WRK utility using the params:

    wrk -d15s -t4 -c64 [URL]

The benchmark has a three kind of tests:

## Scenarios

1. "Simple" test: accept a request and return HTML response with custom dynamic
   header. The test simulates just a single HTML response.

2. "API" test: Check headers, parse path params, query string, JSON body and return a json
   response. The test simulates an JSON REST API.

3. "Upload" test: accept an uploaded file and store it on disk. The test
   simulates multipart formdata processing and work with files.
